I'm Yipeng (Leo) Shen, a third year undergraduate student of [CCST](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/csen/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My major is Computer Science and is expected to graduate in June, 2026.

My research interest lies on **Machine Learning System**. I'm currently working on an internship with [Prof. Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei) of UCSD. I focus on building **scalable** and **efficient** inference framework and serving engine for **multi-agent-system** and base on **SGLang**.

I was advised by [Prof. Peng Lin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/linpeng) from Zhejiang University, aiming at designing a efficent while power effective SNN architecture. I was advised by [Prof. Zeke Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wangzeke) from [RC4ML Lab](https://github.com/RC4ML/), Zhejiang University, focusing on Network on Chips.

You can find my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf) here.
